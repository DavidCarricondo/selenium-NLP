{"2": "Whenever I revisit a classic I'm struck by how much more I get out of it now than I did when I was 24 or 19 or, God forbid, 15. Giving a book like the Grapes of Wrath to a 15 year old serves largely to put them off fine literature for the rest of their lives. The depth of understanding and compassion for the human condition as communicated by a book like this is simply unfathomable to those who haven't lived much life yet, but after you've gotten a healthy dose of living, it comes across like fine music to a trained ear. My heart doesn't bleed for the Joads today as it might have 25 years ago. Yes, it's grim and unfair, but it's no longer shocking or disturbing, and I can see now that Steinbeck didn't intend sensationalism to be the main point. What he's about is revealing the human dignity, the innate goodness and unbreakable pride of these people, and by extension the American people in general, something that still resonates today, especially with reference to the working classes. When the Joads and their kind decline government hand outs, requesting instead the simple opportunity to work hard and be rewarded commensurate with their labor (even if it means a grueling cross-country journey to a place they don't know) one can hear today's white working poors' exasperated disdain for government, insisting that they simply be allowed to keep more of their pay and not be held back in their efforts by nit-picking legalities and cultural trivialities that disapprove of their lifestyles. Sadly, most such people will never read the Grapes of Wrath. Worse yet, many liberal lawmakers won't read it again after high school and won't glean from it an essential understanding about the pride and perseverance of the American working class which the far right is playing like a fiddle much to the detriment of the entire nation. A book like the Grapes of Wrath should be required reading - for every American over 30.", "3": "If you are an American you need to read The Grapes of Wrath. It scares the poop out of me because, my fellow Americans, we are repeating history. If live anywhere else read it as well as a guide for what not to do.\n\nIn the Grapes of Wrath Mr. Steinbeck tells the tale of the first great depression through the Joad family from Oklahoma, who has been displaced from their family farm through no fault of their own. You see, there was a big bad drought which made farming impossible. In those days the family farm fed the family and what they had left over they sold. But when the drought hit the only thing that would grow was cotton, you can\u2019t eat cotton, and that crop sucked the life right out of the soil so no other crop could grow in it for a very long time.\n\n\u201cThese things were lost, and crops were reckoned in dollars, and land was valued by principal plus interest, and crops were bought and sold before they were planted. Then crop failure, drought, and flood were no longer little deaths within life, but simple losses of money. And all their love was thinned with money, and all their fierceness dribbled away in interest until they were no longer farmers at all, but little shopkeepers of crops, little manufacturers who must sell before they can make. Then those farmers who were not good shopkeepers lost their land to good shopkeepers. No matter how clever, how loving a man might be with earth and growing things, he could not survive if he were not also a good shopkeeper. And as time went on, the business men had the farms, and the farms grew larger, but there were fewer of them.\u201d\n\nSome guys with a lot of cash came along and bought up all the struggling family farms and leased the land back to the former family farmers and when they couldn\u2019t produce, the new Owners kicked the families out of their homes. Put them on the streets, children and elderly and all\u2026\u2026..who cares, right? Poor people are less than.\n\nFrom California came hand bills, pamphlets promising jobs and urging the homeless to drag their whole lives via barely moving junk heaps to the golden state where grapes grew in bunches by the side of the road. What choice did they have? They drove across deserts and mountains, losing loved ones along the way, they answered those hand bills in droves. What else could they do?\n\nWhat happened when they got to California? They didn\u2019t get jobs, they got ridicule. They were called Okies and shitheals and were looked down upon. \u201cHow can they live like that?\u201d The people with money would ask, as if being poor was a choice. As if they were just lazy and all it would take to get out of poverty was to get a job\u2026\u2026but there were no fucking jobs. The owners sent out more handbills then they needed to. Why? Because the more men begging for a job the less the owners would have to pay them. Supply and demand. The greedy sons a bitches wanted to pay as little as possible, and that is exactly what they did. The Okies did not have a union of course.\n\n\u201cAnd the great owners, who must lose their land in an upheaval, the great owners with access to history, with eyes to read history and to know the great fact: when property accumulates in too few hands it is taken away. And that companion fact: when a majority of the people are hungry and cold they will take by force what they need. And the little screaming fact that sounds through all history: repression works only to strengthen and knit the repressed. The great owners ignored the three cries of history. The land fell into fewer hands, the number of the dispossessed increased, and every effort of the great owners was directed at repression. The money was spent for arms, for gas to protect the great holdings, and spies were sent to catch the murmuring of revolt so that it might be stamped out. The changing economy was ignored, plans for the change ignored; and only means to destroy revolt were considered, while the causes of revolt went on.\u201d\n\nWho are the \u201cgreat owners\u201d today? The Walton family (of Walmart), six of them, have the same amount of money as the bottom 40% of Americans. That is 124,720,000 people, people. $93 billion\u2026..BILLION and they want more, more money than could be spent in several lifetimes. They don\u2019t need it all, but the rest of America does. Do you think the Walton\u2019s might have an interest in keeping people poor? Go check out who\u2019s in that store at 3am.\n\nLet\u2019s also take a look at who is running against President Obama. Mittens is so rich that he doesn\u2019t even know what a doughnut is, and he\u2019s fighting for the Waltons and all of the 1 %. He\u2019s so rich he thinks he is entitled to the office and \u201cus people\u201d do not need to see his tax returns\u2026\u2026the nerve of us, move on. We need to sit down, shut up, and stop asking questions because he, being a rich bastard, is an \u201cowner\u201d and we should know our place. Not bloody likely.\n\n\u201cOur people are good people; our people are kind people. Pray God some day kind people won\u2019t all be poor. Pray God some day a kid can eat.\nAnd the associations of owners knew that some day the praying would stop.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the end.\u201d\n\n\nAlso posted at Shelfinflicted", "4": "This is another review-as-I-go, which helps me capture my thoughts of the moment, before I forget them!\n\nOne thing that strikes me in these early pages is Steinbeck's technique of focusing on things that are supposedly \"tangential\" to the main narrative of the Joad family but yet are central to their fate. I'm thinking of the descriptions of the natural world like that wonderful chapter about the turtle, who eventually gets scooped up by Tom. You see the world through the turtle's eyes for a moment and you see how the indifference of the characters to nature is a larger phenomenon that leads to their own ruin. Steinbeck reinforces this theme later when he talks about how farmers can no longer afford to feel and relate to nature, that they're basically chemists dealing in nitrogen and machine operators dealing with tractors. But, he says, when the \"wonder\" is gone, people are doomed. And of course the entire book is about the doomed nature of the dust bowl, and this--he says--is how we got there, through this kind of moral breakdown.\n\nThere's another, similar type of moral breakdown at work in the wonderful passage about the car dealers talking about how to rip people off. Here we see other forces--greed, capitalism, deceit--that also serve as a form of human self-sabotage.\n\nThis is what I appreciate so far: that this book is ABOUT SOMETHING! That Steinbeck has something to say about the human endeavor. I find this element missing in so much contemporary fiction, which doesn't really seem to be about much of anything at all.\n\nAs it gets closer to California, and the landscape changes, the first ominous whisperings appear that California will not be the paradise the Joads expect. Still they carry on, feeling like they have no choice, swept up in this tide of history.\n\nAt first the Joads encounter only the cruelty of capitalism--that the large field owners want to have hundreds of thousands of poor workers to choose from because it will keep wages low. Then in the government camp, they finally meet with simple human kindness--really the antithesis of all that. Steinbeck is showing how important kindness is and how it is crushed in the capitalist machine. Money becomes like an ideology, a mask that shields the owners from the consequences of their bad actions. But it's also become necessary for survival. No longer can small farmers work their own land. They are forced into the larger economy, forced to earn wages and participate in the world of money in order to survive. Thus, the Joads are eventually forced to leave the government camp in search of work. Where? They don't know. Somewhere vaguely north.\n\nEventually they find work picking peaches, but they soon become caught up in labor unrest that spills into fatal violence, and they're forced to leave. I won't give away much of what follows. Suffice it to say that the harrowing ordeals don't end there, nor the emphasis on simple human kindness as the antidote to the capitalist machine. Simple human kindness becomes, by the end, the mother's milk that can sustain them, but only barely and uncertainly, and we're left with the indelible portrait of people trying to survive, unsure how it might turn out.\n\nA brave, fierce work that brims with the sense that it doesn't have to be this way--that people have made choices to be cruel but can make choices to be kind, as well. That something has to change because for most people, this architecture and logic of cruelty brings no relief and no joy.", "5": "ENGLISH (The Grapes of Wrath)/ITALIANO\n\nThe Great Depression, told through the journey of one of the many families of farmers fallen on hard times in the 1930s.

To treat them as if they existed in a historical vacuum is as cruel as it is common, and it is the recurring topic of Steinbeck's heartbreaking writing.\n\nSteinbeck is one of those authors that I love unconditionally, more and more with each reading experience. I once travelled from where I lived in Texas to visit Steinbeck country in California - looking for his traces in Monterey and Salinas, always accompanied by his complete works, from hilarious short novels to the heavy epic novels of good and evil. In the end, I discovered his characters in the faces I saw on the road, I smelled his descriptions of nature in the humid or dry, dusty air, I heard his dialogues in the everyday exchanges on markets and in hot small town streets.\n\nI love them all, each one in my carefully kept Steinbeck collection. Asked by one of my children the other day which Steinbeck had influenced me most, I thought I was going to give an evasive, diplomatic answer, not making a statement for or against any specific story. Instead I heard myself say:\n\n\"The Grapes of Wrath!\"\n\nAnd the moment I said it I knew that I meant it. It may not exactly be my favourite Steinbeck, but definitely the one I feel uncomfortably, chillingly getting under my skin immediately. Just recalling the voices of the characters makes me shiver - as they suffer through the ordeal of fleeing from the Dust Bowl, that environmental catastrophe caused by greed and paid for by individual families, to a Californian paradise which doesn't welcome newcomers. The poverty, the suffering, the love and despair - it is tangible in each sentence, in each story line!\n\nFamily saga, social study, historical document, political standpoint, ethical statement on compassion and greed - it is all there, but invisible under the masterfully crafted story, which has its own quality, beyond the message on the essential needs and worries of poor, common people without protective networks.\n\nI don't know how to close this review, as I am not done with this novel at all, despite having read it several times.

You did it.\"", "9": "In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.\n\nThis book really gets my goat. Those poor, dirty Joads. So poor and so, so dirty. After being displaced from their Oklahoma farm following the Dust Bowl storms that wreck their crops and cause them to default on their loans, the Joads find themselves a family of migrants in search of work and food. They join a stream of hundreds of thousands of other migrant families across the United States to what they believe to be the prosperous valleys of California. Only once they arrive, they discover that there is nothing prosperous about it\u2014not only is there a serious shortage of work (mostly caused by an overabundance of labor that came with the influx of so many other migrant families), but they also have to contend with growing anti-migrant sentiment among the local population and wealthy landowners who think nothing of taking advantage of them in their state of vulnerability. Without proper labor laws protecting worker\u2019s rights and no trade unions to represent their interests, the Joads are severely underpaid for whatever work they do manage to find, and they simply fall deeper and deeper into despondency.\n\nThe reason this gets my goat is \u2018cause it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Yes, the Joads are uneducated and wouldn\u2019t qualify for anything more than basic manual labor. Yes, it is the Great Depression and this is not an easy time to find a job even for skilled workers. And yes, they are a family of 47 and they probably look pretty ridiculous all crammed up in the back of their makeshift pickup truck. But gosh darn it, if only they had unions! If only they had fair labor standards to guarantee them a minimum wage! If only they had the protection of government legislation to prohibit wealthy landowners from colluding to keep prices high and wages low!\n\nWhich leads me to wonder\u2026 what would Ayn Rand think of all this? After all, aren\u2019t labor unions and economic regulation precisely what she argues against? By that account, if Atlas Shrugged is the supposed Bible of right-wing thinkers, then I\u2019d have to say that The Grapes of Wrath might just be its antithesis. But the real difference, as far as I can tell, is that while Atlas Shrugged represents a crazy woman\u2019s vision of a whack job world that could never actually exist, John Steinbeck tells it like it is, and how it was, for so many hard working Americans who were taken advantage of under a system that did nothing to protect them. And what\u2019s even more remarkable is that Steinbeck\u2019s characters (whom, by the way, Rand would refer to as \u201cmoochers\u201d\u2014just thought we should be clear on that) make Dagny Taggart and Henry Reardon look like a couple of pussies. What is it Ma Joad says?

Most of the 4 and 5 star ratings came from those who read it as adults. I recommend listening to those who read it as adults.\n\nMany people hate the ending, but I thought it was great. Creepy? Yes, but there was an immense amount of beauty and generosity in that creepy little ending. At one point in the story, Ma tol' Rosasharn that it ain't all about her (most high school kids think everything is all about them, which is probably one reason they couldn't enjoy this book or most other classics they are forced to read). Realizing this at the very end made Rosasharn crack her first smile in ages (at least that's my take on the mysterious smile). I wasn't disappointed in the lack of closure at the end, because the closure came in the middle when Ma said, \"Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good an' they die out. But we keep a'comin'. We're the people that live. They can't wipe us out; they can't lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa, 'cause we're the people.\" So you know they will be fine whether life continues to be a struggle or not. They will be better off than the rich man with the million acres they talked about - \"If he needs a million acres to make him feel rich, seems to me he needs it 'cause he feels awful poor inside hisself, and if he's poor in hisself, there ain't no million acres gonna make him feel rich, an' maybe he's disappointed that nothin' he can do'll make him feel rich.\" Another good quote is \"I'm learnin' one thing good...If you're in trouble or hurt or need - go to the poor people. They're the only ones that'll help - the only ones.\" I saw a special on 20/20 around Christmas time about how the lower class are more generous overall than the middle and upper class, so this still applies today.

But that love has been tested before. I am speaking, of course, about school, and in particular, about a succession of uninspired English teachers foisting uninspired syllabi upon their disinterested students. It only takes one fourth-rate translation of Crime and Punishment to make you foreswear the written word in favor of the videogame console.\n\nMaybe it was the very fact that I was being forced to read that did it. Whatever the reason, I spent most of high school and college absorbing very little of value from my literature courses.\n\nJohn Steinbeck\u2019s The Grapes of Wrath was the exception. You can keep To Kill a Mockingbird and (especially) Catcher in the Rye. It was Steinbeck\u2019s sturdy portrayal of the itinerant Joad family, leaving the dustbowl of Oklahoma for the green fields of California, that captured my imagination.\n\nMy reasons for enjoying The Grapes of Wrath are probably the same reasons that this perennially-assigned book has so many critical detractors. I loved the simplicity of the language, which eschewed formal daring (i.e., pretentiousness) in favor of a lyrical plainness that brought to mind Robert Penn Warren. I also appreciated the blunt-force of the message. There is very little subtlety here. Instead, it is a parable, filled with obvious symbolism and rife with meanings. Steinbeck does not try to hide his message; he is not endeavoring to get you to spend the rest of your days attempting to translate the runes.\n\nThis summer, I decided to test my recollection with a reread, while also consuming another bona fide classic. Coming on the heels of Les Mis\u00e9rables, the 528-page Okie epic felt practically brisk.\n\nA summary of The Grapes of Wrath is incredibly straightforward (which was probably another reason I appreciated this as a student). It opens with Tom Joad on his way home from prison, where he has served four years for manslaughter. The home he finds, however, is changing fast. Dry weather is destroying the crops, and corporate-owned tractors are driving off the tenant farmers. Soon enough, Tom and the Joad family (Pa and Ma; Granpa and Granma; Uncle John; brothers Al, Noah, and Winfield; and sisters Rose of Sharon and Ruthie), along with former preacher Jim Casy, hop in a beat-up old truck and hit Route 66. In their journey to California, and their encounters once they arrive, we experience themes \u2013 the white working class; economic inequality; migration \u2013 that seem as relevant as ever.\n\nPerhaps the most striking thing about The Grapes of Wrath (which is otherwise proudly straight-down-the-middle), is its use of intercalary chapters. It is a structure that can possibly determine \u2013 on its own \u2013 your reaction to Steinbeck\u2019s opus. The intercalary chapters are cutaway scenes that are inserted throughout the central narrative. They have nothing to do with the Joad family whatsoever and consist of descriptions of the weather; vignettes between unrelated characters; and towards the end of the novel, a fierce denunciation of merciless profiteering:\n\nThe people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river, and the guards hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the kerosene is sprayed. And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quick-lime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.\n\n\nAs you might have guessed already, I am fine with these chapters. In fact, some of them I really liked. One clever chapter, for instance, is told in stream-of-conscious style from the perspective of a used car salesman as he gulls the hicks and rubes who wander onto his lot. Of course, one can view this quite differently, as mere filler that needlessly swells an otherwise spare storyline. I will acknowledge that it is an arguable point. Yet in adding these sections, Steinbeck is able to create the larger context through which the Joad family is moving, adding a mythic overlay to their journey, making it into a modernized version of westward pioneers in their covered wagons.\n\nFor me, the most impressive thing about Steinbeck\u2019s writing is his uncanny and immersive powers of description. When he paints a scene, he fills out the canvas, all the way to the edges. You know what a thing looks like; how the heat feels; what sound the wind is making:\n\nA gentle wind followed by rain clouds, driving them northward, a wind that softly clashed the drying corn. A day went by and the wind increased, steady, unbroken by gusts. The dust from the roads fluffed up and spread out and fell on the weeds beside the fields, and fell into the fields a little way. Now the wind grew strong and hard and it worked at the rain crust in the corn fields. Little by little the sky was darkened by the mixing dust, and the wind felt over the earth, loosened the dust, and carried it away. The wind grew stronger. The rain crust broke and the dust lifted up out of the fields and drove gray plumes into the air like sluggish smoke. The corn threshed the wind and made a dry, rushing sound. The finest dust did not settle back to earth now, but disappeared into the darkening sky\u2026\n\n\nThe characters are admittedly archetypes, which is a fancy way of saying they are built from the feet-up with clich\u00e9s. Still, Steinbeck draws everyone, even side characters like Uncle John, with great vividness. The lodestar of the group is Ma, fierce and tough as a cob, willing to do anything to keep the family together, and imbued with a pragmatic wisdom:\n\n\u201cAin't you thinkin\u2019 what\u2019s it gonna be like when we get there?\u201d [Al asked]. \u201cAin't you scared it won\u2019t be nice like we thought?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d [Ma] said quickly. \u201cNo, I ain't. You can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s too much \u2013 livin\u2019 too many lives. Up ahead they\u2019s a thousan\u2019 lives we might live, but when it comes, it\u2019ll on\u2019y be one\u2026\u201d\n\n\nOne of the ways you know an author has done a good job with a character is when you feel yourself hating him or her with great passion. In that regard, Steinbeck also succeeds, as selfish Al, senseless Winfield, whining Rose of Sharon, and hopeless Ruthie all drove me nuts. Now, you might say that\u2019s the bulk of the cast. That is correct. Things are helped along, however, by a lot of witty dialogue, ribald humor (including a couple Tom Joad penis jokes), and genuinely tense confrontations.\n\n(There is also the general implication that human beings, on occasion, engage in sexual relations, a fact that caused at least one contemporary critic to label this \u201cpornography.\u201d It is not, dear reader, pornography).\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath has always been attended by controversy. Some of it stems from the aforementioned earthiness. More of it comes from Steinbeck\u2019s alleged politics. The charge, as is often the case if someone gives the free market the side-eye, is that Steinbeck was espousing Communism. Certainly, he was a pro-labor leftist, and accordingly showed some sympathy with the cause. But Steinbeck really tried to avoid being pigeonholed into one ideology. At the end of the day, he was interested in people, and the only theory that he delineates with any kind of coherence is the belief in the power of people working together.\n\nTo be sure, there is within these pages a critique of capitalism and the way it \u2013 in its purest form \u2013 can wring a person\u2019s life for a bigger margin of profit. This came from an honest place, as Steinbeck covered migrant workers during the Great Depression as a journalist. He went to Hoovervilles and government camps. He collected the stories. His sympathies were with the worker and their mistreatment served as the wellspring of his anger. Near the end of The Grapes of Wrath, when he finally unleashes a barrage at unrestrained corporate capitalism, it still feels raw, eighty years after it was published.\n\nSteinbeck believed a revolution was coming. Ultimately, he was wrong about the shape history was taking. Perhaps he misread the tea leaves. More likely, the sudden explosion of the Second World War, which created millions of jobs, cut the revolution off at the knees.\n\n(The irony is that the Joad family, derided by Californians as \u201cReds,\u201d are innately conservative people who were intent on avoiding government handouts. After Pearl Harbor, they likely found decent defense industry jobs and got Ma that white house she was always dreaming on. Heck, the next generation probably voted for Reagan. Commies, indeed!).\n\nUnpacking the controversies and the politics and the symbolism and even the timelessness are beside the point. What makes The Grapes of Wrath a great novel is that it transports you into a fully-realized world, with fully-realized characters. When I finished the final page (even with its whacky ending), the story did not end. I continued to think about the characters, to imagine where they might go next. And even when I stopped actually thinking about them, I still remembered them.\n\nIt has been twenty years since I read this last, and upon reading it again, it struck me that I had never forgotten it in the first place.", "12": "How can you frighten a man whose hunger is not only in his own cramped stomach but in the wretched bellies of his children?\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath won John Steinbeck both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, firmly engraving his name on the stone tablet featuring the canon of Great American Writers. Published in 1939, it is arguably Steinbeck's best known work and is still widely read today. Admirers praised Steinbeck for writing an epic tale of Biblical proportions, singing songs of the common men and women and their struggle against exploitation by the rich and powerful, the strength of a family and the endurance human spirit in the Great Depression and the tragedy of the Dust Bowl, which forced many families to abandon land which was their livelihood for generations. Detractors accuse Steinbeck of being sentimental and one-sided, of greatly exaggerating the effect that the period and the surrounding had on the people he describes, of being a socialist, a Marxist, a communist and a propagandist (sometimes not all at once). Associated Farmers of California called the book \"a pack of lies\" and \"communist propaganda\", while Burton Rascoe writing for Newsweek added that The Grapes of Wrath was nothing more than superficial observation, careless infidelity to the proper use of idiom, tasteless pornographical and scatagorical talk.\n\nCriticism didn't stop at negative reviews. The book was banned across the country and sometimes publicly burned by enraged citizens; Steinbeck received hate mail and death threats. The book made him a lot of powerful enemies. The Associated Farmers have begun an hysterical personal attack on me both in the papers and a whispering campaign, he said, I\u2019m a Jew,a pervert, a drunk, a dope fiend. A whispering smear campaign against Steinbeck was set in motion by his new enemies, aiming to defame him and turn him from a celebrated author into a figure of hatred: they accused him of being a Jew, who wanted to deliberately undermine the economy and acted in Zionist-communist interest. The Associated Farmers are really working up a campaign, he wrote to his agent, I have made powerful enemies with the Grapes. They will not kill me, I think, but they will destroy me if and when they can. He was right. When Lewis Milestone, author of the screenplay for Mice and Men came to central California to explore possible locations for the movie, Steinbeck never stopped at any ranches in fear that they might get physically assaulted by their residents. The undersheriff of Santa Clara County was a friend of Steinbeck, and warned him to never stay in a hotel room alone: the boys got a rape case set for you. You get alone in a hotel and a dame will come in, tear off her clothes, scratch her face and scream and you try to talk yourself out of that one. They won\u2019t touch your book but there\u2019s easier ways. Steinbeck found himself under enormous stress and strain as he realized that Associated Farmers controlled the sheriff's office in California, and were \"capable of anything\"; he was also investigated by the FBI under president Hoover, which saw him as a dangerous subversive. He had to adopt an alias while visiting Los Angeles and keep secret files. He was aware that most of the people who hated him have themselves been victims of propaganda used precisely by those who accused him of being a propagandist; he told his agent that The articles written against me are all by people who admit they haven\u2019t read Grapes, indeed wouldn't dirty their minds with it.\n\n\nJohn Steinbeck in 1939, when the book was published.\n\nStill, at the same time, many other readers found The Grapes of Wrath to be enthralling and necessary - a book which attracted attention to the plight of poor migrant farm workers to the West, showed the brutality and harshness of their condition and challenged the nation to do better for those people. Earle Birney called the book a deed - the act of a man out of the pity and wrath of his heart, and it was read and loved as such. It captured the turbulent period of American history and provoked a reaction. It made an impact, a real and lasting one - which is its greatest achievement. Interestingly enough, within months of its publication journalist Carey McWilliams published his own work on treatment of migrant workers in California. Factories in the Field: The Story of Migratory Farm Labor in California was a landmark study which exposed the social and environmental damage inflicted by the growth of corporate agriculture in California, and a condemnation of both the politics and consequences of large-scale agribusiness. McWilliams documented the social and economic trends which led to establishment of huge land holdings in California and the constant need for cheap migrant labor; he found that the \"Okies\" were only the latest group to be exploited by the invisible owners of California's first industry. The previous groups included Native Americans and immigrants from China, Japan, Mexico, India, Armenia and the Philippines. Shortly before the publication of Factories in the Field, McWilliams became the head of California's Division of Immigration and Housing where he focused on improving wages for agricultural workers and their living conditions; he increased inspections of labor camps owned by the growers, as he felt that on-farm housing made the workers more dependent on their employers, and changed the formula which was used to deny relief to workers who refused to accept farm work at prevailing piece wages, effectively forcing some of the growers to increase their piece rates. Understandably, McWilliams and his work were also not well received by California growers; they called him an Agricultural Pest Number One, worse than pear blight or boll weevils, and accused of conspiring together with Steinbeck to ruin their reputation. Funnily enough the two never met, and did not arrange the release dates of their work in any way.\n\n(McWilliams was also involved in the committee led by senator Robert La Follette Jr., which became known as La Follette Civil Liberties Committee and which has performed the most extensive investigation in American history into employer violations of the rights or workers to organize and bargain collectively. Between 1936 and 1941, the committee conducted extensive hearings and collected a vast number of testimonies. These hearings exposed the tactics used by America's leading corporations to prevent their workers from forming unions: employment of extensive industrial espionage and strikebreaking services, stockpiling munitions such as submachine guns, rifles and tear gas, and even subverting local law by hiring their own police forces. The committee closed its hearings in late 1939 and early 1940, when it traveled up and down the California coast and collected testimonies of more than four hundred labor organizers, growers and farm workers. McWilliams ghostwrote the committee's report, a stern indictment of California's agricultural factory system, but it was not presented to Congress until October 1942, without much impact: no one was listening and no one cared, for we were at war.\n\nMcWilliams felt that the War enabled both growers and state officials from implementing a reform which they would almost certainly would have been forced to implement otherwise, and that the whole country went to sleep until a young black girl named Rosa Parks refused to go to the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955. He, however, did not stay silent and stop working. On the contrary, failure to implement recommended reforms seemed to give him more strength to combat injustice: he published Prejudice: Japanese Americans, Symbol of Racial Intolerance, a sharp critique and a chronicle of internment of Japanese-Americans during the War, and was active in opposing McCarthyism. In 1960 Carey McWilliams became the first American reporter to reveal that the CIA was training a group of Cuban exiles in Guatemala to serve as guerrillas in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. His article appeared in October, five months before the invasion happened. He died in 1980.)\n\n\nCarey McWilliams, a good man.\n\nThe copy of The Grapes of Wrath that I read had a great introduction by Robert DeMott, who provided plenty of excerpts from Steinbeck's journal and revealed his ambitions and doubts as he was composing the book. Steinbeck was convinced that if he could \"do the book properly\", it would be a truly American book and \"one of the really fine books\". At the same time, he was constantly thinking about what he perceived to be his own lack of ability and limitations as a writer, which greatly troubled him. Honesty was what he saw as the answer and the way to write the book - if he could keep the honesty in, everything would be fine.\n\nSteibeck had plenty of opportunity to do exactly that. While his initial writings have not been successful, he struck a chord with 1935's Tortilla Flat which tells the story of Danny and his friends, a group of paisanos who live in post-war Monterey. But real success came with a series of California novels, stories of common people trying to make it during the Great Depression - In Dubious Battle, Of Mice and Men and the most important one, The Grapes of Wrath.\n\nThe severe drought of the early 1930's resulted in a massive agricultural failure in the southern region of the Great Plains, above all in western Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle, where the fields have been heavily overcultivated by wheat farmers after the first World War. The area consisted of millions of acres of exposed topsoil, no longer anchored by growing roots as the crops withered and died from lack of rainfall. Constant sunshine dried the soil and turned it into dust, which then blew away in amounts sufficient to black out the sky and reduce visibility to a few feet; these immense dust storms centered on the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas, and the adjacent areas of Kansas, Colorado and New Mexico. By the mid 1930's countless families have been deprived of means to earn their livelihood, pay their mortgages and buy equipment necessary to stay competitive with growing industrialization. Dust Bowl victims were forced to leave their lands, and without any real prospects of employment move to California - the promised land.\n\n\nA dust storm hitting Boise City, right in the panhandle of Oklahoma on April 14th, 1935. This storm was particularly severe, and was one of the worst dust storms in American history, causing immense economic and agricultural damage - it is estimated to have displaced 300 million tons of topsoil in the Great Plains. It became known as the Black Sunday. (Right click - open in a new tab for a bigger photo)\n\nIn 1936 Steinbeck was hired by the San Francisco News, which commissioned him to write a series of articles on the Dust Bowl migration. To write the seven articles, published as The Harvest Gypsies, Steinbeck traveled to California and visited local labor camps, shantytowns and Hoovervilles - migrant settlements named so after President Herbert Hoover, who was widely blamed for the Depression. There he met Tom Collins, manager of the Weedpatch Camp who became a major source of information and a travelling companion. Collins collected statistics on camp life which Steinbeck used as primary material for his articles, and both traveled together on three trips through California. They visited the settlements, went to meetings, stayed on camps and ranches, worked in the fields. After the publication Steinbeck and his wife drove west along Route 66, from Oklahoma to California, like countless migrants before them.\n\nThese experiences provided Steinbeck with more than enough material to depict the lives of poor farmers forced to migrate west. He set out to write a novel, conscious of the importance of what he saw and experienced. I am not writing a satisfying story, he told his editor, Pascal Covici. I've done my damnedest to rip a reader's nerves to rags, I don't want him satisfied...I tried to write this book the way lives are being lived not the way books are written.\n\nAll through the process, Steinbeck remained aware of the fact that he was creating a literary work. DeMott describes The Grapes of Wrath as an engaged novel with a partisan posture, many complex voices, and passionate prose styles. Steinbeck saw the composition process of the novel similar to the composition of a symphony - he wanted his chapters, voices and styles speak to each other, resonate with recurring themes, the total impression far more powerful than its individual parts.\n\nSteinbeck wrote of events and people he himself experienced and knew, and his concern was humanitarian: to do justice to the migrant men and women, their desire to work and their efforts to retain their dignity and settle in the Promised Land, be an advocate for the common working people whose abuse by their corporate employers was largely a silent tragedy. Men willing to work were hungry and starved in the land of plenty, which for Steinbeck (and any moral human being) was unacceptable; He sided with David rather than Goliath, and set out to write an epic which would surpass all of his other work. This must be a good book, he wrote in his journal, it simply must. I haven't any choice. It must be far and away the best thing I have ever attempted - slow but sure, piling detail on detail until a picture and an experience emerge. Until the whole throbbing thing emerges.\n\nSteinbeck was aware of his ambition and consciously employed imagery from and parallels to the single best read epic text in the US - the Bible. The exodus of the Joad family to California was written with the attention and momentum of the Biblical Exodus of the Isrealites, led by Moses out of Egypt. California is the Promised Land, a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey (Exodus 3:7-9). The Okies arriving at the border of California are stopped by the border patrol guards, who refuse to let them enter (except for when the labor is needed) - much like the Israelites faced persecution and cruelty from the Amonites, Moabites and Edomites when they were trying to enter Caanan. Tom Joad can be seen as Moses - he killed a man who spoke bad about Jim Casy, like Moses killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew slave, and both served as leader figures for their people. Jim Casy is a Christ figure, down to the same initials - a preacher who questioned the established religion and fought the temptations of flesh, and lead the twelve Joads like Christ lead his twelve disciples. Like Jesus, he disappeared and wandered alone; He taught the gospel of social and spiritual unity: love for all men, sympathy for the poor and oppressed. (view spoiler).\nThe Joads depend on their car like Noah depended on his ark, and like Noah gathered all the necessary species to preserve life on earth they gathered all their important things to ensure their own survival. The old Testament practically jumps off the page - there's even a literal flood in this story.\n\nIt is also interesting to see from the perspective of a contemporary reader how the novel reads like a perfect example of a dystopian novel: large banks took hold over the land of the Joads and evicted them from it, forcing them to leave their native land of Oklahoma where society has collapsed and migrate towards a new, better world. The theme of large corporations and financial institutions effectively assuming control over lives of individual people is a classic dystopian theme, and so is the journey of a group of those who survived the collapse of society - classic example being The Stand, more recent being the Pulizer winning The Road. Steinbeck's landscape is bleak and hostile, his protagonists experience real life-threatening risks and deprivations which forces them to cross many boundaries.\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath became the most successful social protest novel of the 20th century, and its message remains fresh and accurate even today, especially today. We live in a period characterized by growing income inequality and the widening gap between the richest and the poorest, where certain institutions of the financial sector have been deemed \"too big to fail\" effectively making them more dangerous than ever. Corporations lobby the politicians to ensure that their own interests are met, and enjoy a wide range of big government subsidies and tax breaks, sponsored by ordinary citizens. While the big corporations enjoy all the benefits guaranteed by a big, nanny state ordinary citizens are being told that they don't deserve it and that they have to help themselves and pull themselves up by their own bootstraps; politicians and pundits use the words \"welfare\" in pejorative context when it comes to their own viewers and constituents, as if it was something shameful instead of an extended hand, which helps the ordinary working people stay afloat. A welfare state is inconsiderable if it could actually benefit those who need it most - the poor and struggling ordinary citizens, who are left to walk on their own and slowly cross to the other side. In this vision of society all that I regard as a vice is turned into a virtue: greed, selfishness and no care for the weaker, a world where people push forward with sharp elbows and know the price of everything and the value of nothing.\n\nAmerican economist Robert Reich recently made a succinct post on his Facebook page, which I quote here in its entirety (emphasis mine). Play us out, Mr. Reich.\n\n\"One of the legacies of the Reagan-Thatcher era -- which is very much still with us -- was to denigrate the very idea of the \"public good.\" Anything preceded by the adjective \"public\" -- public schools, public transportation, public parks, public libraries, public welfare -- was (and is) suspect. The private sector, it was assumed, could do it better; competition and the profit motive would generate savings and efficiencies; citizens would be better served if they were treated as \"customers\" and \"clients.\" Well, we now have three decades to assess the results. What happened? \"Privatization\" has meant more profits for the private sector, better services for those wealthy enough to pay more for them, and poorer services and higher taxes for almost everyone else. The rich have seceded into their own private schools, private jets, private health clubs, and privatized communities; most Americans must now pay individually for what previous generations paid for collectively, through their taxes. Certain public goods, like higher education, have morphed into private investments. But the biggest loss, I think, has been our sense of the common good itself: out understanding that we are all in it together, that we are bound together by an implicit social contract involving obligations to one another that define a decent society, and that much of what we have and enjoy in life depends on what we achieve in common with others.\"", "13": "I\u2019m listening to the Audiobook. It\u2019s sooooo good!!!!\n\nI\u2019ve read the book. I\u2019ve seen the stage production, but I never listen to the audiobook.... and the narrator\u2019s are so so terrific!!!!", "14": "OMGOSH! Powerful and Tragic.......with an ending NEVER to be forgotten!\nIn THE GRAPES OF WRATH, hard times plague the Joad family from beginning to end, and chronicle the Great Depression of the 1930's. No rain, dust storms and the dreaded \"monster\" bank ended a much-loved and long-lived way of life forcing farmers to become migrant workers traveling from one unwelcome place to another; and No work + No money = No food, but the Joad's never give up despite being tired, beaten down, angry and sad. They shared their lives, what little food they had and gave everything of themselves as you will see by the remarkable conclusion of this 1939 classic.\n\"Jus' try to live the day, jus' the day.\"\nWhile not a particularly fast read, Steinbeck (my #1 favorite author) creates realistic characters and devotes several (short) interim chapters (including Chapter 1) to developing an atmospheric description of the time, and.......\nWhile EAST OF EDEN continues to be one of my all-time favorite reads, I definitely felt THE GRAPES OF WRATH deserving of a 5 Star rating as well. \"It is a work conceived on a completely different plane.\"", "15": "Oklahoma, 1939. Tractors invade the barren plains, ruining crops, demolishing houses, stripping farmers of their livelihood, leaving only billows of dust and ransacked land behind. Bewildered families choke with disbelief at the lame excuses of the landowners who blame a monster bigger than them. Not the severe droughts, not the iron machines, not their useless greed, but the bank, the bank forced them to do it.\nAnd so a pilgrimage of thousands of destitute families to the promised land of California where the valleys are ripe with fresh hope and sweet grapes begins, and the roads become a limbless reptile hauling an endless tail of wrecked trucks and rootless people who have exchanged their living heritage for the expectation of honest jobs and decent lives.\n\nA debunked list of thwarted illusions and betrayed promises awaits the Joads, the protagonists of Steinbeck\u2019s tale of protest and epitomization of countless second rate Americans who had to endure the degradation of being treated like cattle, the marginalization of inhuman living conditions and the bigoted treatment of their fellow citizens as a result of the Great Depression\u2019s climatic, social and economic debacle.\nMore than seventy years later, Steinbeck's denouncement of the effects of an abusive system that endorses laws of supply and demand over humanity and social justice mirrors the precarious situation of many developed countries that are struggling against unmanageable unemployment rates and massive migratory movements, which elevates the writer\u2019s prophetic voice of protest to an enduring literary classic that speaks on its own.\n\n\u201cThe Grapes of Wrath\u201d is composed of juxtaposed symphonic alternating movements. Short, jazzy and lyrical chapters combining journalistic language with spiritual rhythms give an atemporal view on the migrant drama, which in turn arise as premonitory for the interweaved longer narrative chapters depicting the Joad family\u2019s exodus to California and their symbolic plight for moral equity.\nFramed in bold dialogue and raw dialectical jargon, a menagerie of styles, dissonant voices, folk wisdom and biblical imagery gives shape to the mystic soul of the book, which orbits around two concentric points: land and family.\nWhen the Joads are obliged to abandon their farm they are also deprived of their dignity, of their ancestry, of their roots. Once the land is lost, drastic developments threaten the family unit but Ma Joad, tough and vulnerable mother, resilient and respectful wife, gentle and brawly cornerstone of the Joads' collective willpower, and her son Tom, the male counterpoint to Ma\u2019s ability to adapt, personify the indignation that fuels the spark of revolt to preserve self-respect in front of implacable adversity.\nBut when hope becomes desperation, desperation melts in prayer, prayer degenerates into hunger and hunger ferments in wrath and the skies break lose in floods of misfortune and a mother caresses the disfigured face of her son in the dark, the debilitated bonds that kept the family together shatter silently in fragmented impotence and paralyzing vexation, leaving only one absolute, pulsating soul that speaks for all people, the ghost of Tom Joad:\n\n\u201cThen it don\u2019t matter. Then I\u2019ll be aroun\u2019 in the dark. I\u2019ll be ever\u2019where \u2013 wherever you look. Wherever they\u2019s a fight so hungry people can eat, I\u2019ll be there. Wherever they\u2019s a cop beatin\u2019 up a guy. I\u2019ll be there. I\u2019ll be in the way kids laugh when they\u2019re hungry an\u2019 they know supper\u2019s ready. An\u2019 when our folks eat the stuff they raise an\u2019 live in the houses they build \u2013 why, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\n\nAnd this is how Steinbeck\u2019s polivalent epic evolves from socio-economic determinism to numinous spirituality, for the fury of losing land and lineage metamorphoses into a chant of redemptive love for mankind that overcomes individual boundaries, temporal limits and material needs and rekindles a perdurable harmonious faith that can only be born of the most inexhaustible and universal compassion.\n\n\u201cThe people in flight from terror behind \u2013 strange things happen to them, some bitterly cruel and some so beautiful that the faith is refired forever.\u201d", "16": "Chirst. This was a tough one to read.\n\nI don't just mean it was depressing. It was, obviously - a book about a poor family being forced from their home during the Great Depression and having to beg for the chance to pick cotton at fifteen cents per hour can't be anything except depressing - but it wasn't the most depressing book I've ever read. That honor probably goes to The Hunchback of Notre Dame, although I guess Angela's Ashes is a close second.\n\nThis was hard to read, not because it was a portrayal of a horrible period of history that actually happened. That contributed to the tragedy of the book, of course, coupled with the knowledge that there were not just a few Joad families during the Great Depression, but millions of them, so your percentage of possible happy endings is going to be pretty low.\n\nIt wasn't even sad because Steinbeck was using the backdrop of the Great Depression to illustrate the greater problems in America - the disparity between rich and poor, the way low-level laborers have to fight tooth and nail to achieve the most basic human rights, the fact that the people who run the major banks and farms are horrible unfeeling shells of human beings, etc.\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath is sad for all of these reasons, but here is what makes it sadder than anything: not the fact that Steinbeck is writing about a horrible period in history that's behind us now. It's because that horrible period went away, and then it came back. We aren't in the middle of a second Dust Bowl, but make no mistake: we are living in the second Great Depression.\n\nIf you haven't read yet and have always been meaning to, there's no better time than now. Steinbeck's book was written in the late 1930's, but just about everything that happens here is happening right in your state - possibly in your neighborhood - as you read this. You read about the banks in the Great Depression sending men to bulldoze people's houses while the family stood outside, and find yourself thinking, \"Well, at least now they just pile all your stuff on the curb after you get foreclosed on.\" You read about migrant families accepting offers to work all day at pitiful wages, because fifteen cents an hour is still better than zero cents an hour and the kids have to eat, and you think about the immigrants who pick your food in exchange for shitty wages. You read about the Joad family and the others being called \"Okies\" and forced out of their camps by the cops, and think about politicians who scream about \"illegals\" taking away the good American jobs and deporting kids' parents.\n\nIs this review getting too politcally-minded? Good. That's how Steinbeck would have wanted me to talk about his book, because let me assure you - The Grapes of Wrath is extremely fucking political. Another reviewer called it the anti-Atlas Shrugged, which is pretty damn apt. It's all about unions and the rights of the worker and how poor people need government assistance because sometimes life just sucks for no fucking reason.\n\nIt's sad and it's searing, and beautifully written, and unrelentingly depressing. But it should be read.\n\n(the only reason this gets four stars instead of five is because of the ending. Look, I know that Steinbeck didn't have to give the Joads a happy ending, and I'm not saying he gave them a sad one either - he gave them a weird one instead. I was already pretty sick of hearing about Rose of Sharon and her magical pregnancy, so it was just the cherry on top of a shit subplot sundae that the ending (view spoiler)", "17": "I\u2019ve read the book \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath\u201d Written by John Steinbeck.\n\nSteinbeck describes the hardships, readers, moods and developments very forcefully.

John Steinbeck manages to transfer feelings directly to the reader.\nNevertheless, it is very easy to understand with the language level he choosed.\nThat being said, i was delighted to find that it was really exciting - a literary delight. This man really can write! It is characterized by a striking language that avoids sentimentalities and therefore looks very honest.\nExciting until the end!", "18": "This was a library book. I didn't get on with it at all despite trying to read it twice. I gave up about a third of the way through in the end.\n\nIt is about the life of one American family during the Great Depression. There is some beautiful creative writing in places but the story itself is so very slow. It just didn't hold my interest due to the lengthy dialogue between the characters who were talking about nothing in particular. It was like being a fly on the wall at a really dull tea party where everyone is making small talk. It seems they were allowing waves of nostalgia to sweep over them--forcing everyone to listen as one by one they recounted monotonous tales from their youth.\n\nI guess I probably shouldn't make such comments about something labelled a classic, but for me it was not. As a Christian, I also found the language, particularly the regular blasphemy, offensive and would probably have stopped reading earlier for that reason had it not been a classic. I also didn't appreciate the early scenes where the local vicar was using his position to bed all of the young women in his parish.\n\nI don't recommend this book due to the language, the sexual content and the monotony, I'm sorry I wasted a few hours on it.

I was blown away by the scope of the work, how it followed not just the Joad family traveling from Oklahoma to California, but it also meditated on the problems of all the displaced families of the Great Depression, and on all the poor farmers who were driven from their homes and their lands by Big Banks and Greedy Corporations. Many of those farmers ended up in California, hoping to find work and a decent living, but instead found menial wages, prejudice, hunger and disease. It's a devastating chapter of American history.\n\nI listened to this on audio, read by the talented actor Dylan Baker, and I would highly recommend his performance. I also recommend the 1940 film version directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda, which was mostly faithful to the book. In the movie, Fonda seems to be carrying the entire weight of the Depression on his shoulders.\n\nI think what is most alarming about reading The Grapes of Wrath in the early 21st century is recognizing how relevant the themes are today, because the country is still run by big banks and greedy corporations. Karl Marx was right: The working class is oppressed, y'all.\n\nFive stars for the impressive John Steinbeck. Five stars for the Joad family, searching for a new life. And five stars for Dylan Baker's excellent narration.\n\nFavorite Quotes\n\"There ain't no sin and there ain't no virtue.

And since old Tom and the children could not know hurt or fear unless she acknowledged hurt or fear, she had practiced denying them in herself. And since, when a joyful thing happened, they looked to see whether joy was on her, it was her habit to build laughter out of inadequate materials....She seemed to know that if she swayed the family shook, and if she ever deeply wavered or despaired the family would fall.\"\n\n\"If he needs a million acres to make him feel rich, seems to me he needs it 'cause he feels awful poor inside hisself, and if he's poor in hisself, there ain't no million acres gonna make him feel rich, an' maybe he's disappointed that nothin' he can do 'll make him feel rich.\"\n\n\"Sure, cried the tenant men,but it\u2019s our land\u2026We were born on it, and we got killed on it, died on it.

John Steinbeck has a way of depicting society and people in a raw and honest way that leaves you with a hollow feeling inside, and yet you devour his books because they are so amazing.\nIn \"The Grapes of Wrath\" we meet Tom, who has just been released from prison on probation, as well as his family who's about to move to the West because banks and tractors have evicted them from their own home and land. It's USA in the middle of the Great Depression and times are changing. Everyone is moving from East to West in order to find work and survive these new and abhorrent circumstances.\nIn many ways, the writing of this book is very straight-forward, but at the same time it digs deeper when you read between the lines and look behind the characters' behaviour and dialogue. I was especially fond of how Steinbeck, at every other chapter, stops up to depict the conditions in America at that point in time; whether it be about a car seller and his greediness, the devastating conditions for the workers in the fruit fields or a turtle.\nI was a big fan, and especially the ending left me speechless. Until now, \"East of Eden\" has been my favourite of Steinbeck's, but \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is a close runner-up.", "21": "An unflinching look at the toil endured during the Depression by Okies, uprooted from their home and dispossessed of their sense of belonging in the wake of the Dust Bowl. Through the lens of one family\u2019s journey to California in search of stability, the novel examines the hardships of migrant life and the evils of capitalism, homing in on the relationship between power, wealth, and labor. At his best Steinbeck subtly captures the nuances of family bonds and draws a forceful realist portrait of the West, but the novel\u2019s bogged down by clunky religious symbolism.", "22": "The Grapes of Wrath is a story about the pursuit of power by a few selected individuals and its domino effects on the society and the lives of thousands of people. While the story itself is set on the times of the Great Depression, back in the 1930s and 1940s, we can still trace parallels with the contemporary world we\u2019re living in more than 60 years later. Sadly, still to this day, we can see in the news that there are people working for less than the minimal wage and under slave labor conditions.\n\nTo tell us this story, John Steinbeck presents to us the life of the Joads: a big united, poor family who lives in Oklahoma under a tenancy system until their lives start to derail - because of the drought, tightness of money, agricultural changes (now a tractor can put ten families out of work\u2026) -, which leads them to a hopeful journey to California in search of jobs, dignity, happiness and means to fulfill their simple dreams: Ma Joad would love to have her \u201clittle white house\u201d; all Grandpa wanted was to have grapes soaking his beard; and Rose of Sharon fantasized about having ice in her house.\n\nSlow paced and packed with long descriptions, I imagined it would take me up to three weeks to get through the book by my reading standards; it took me nine days instead. It was impossible to not start caring about the family right away or to stop desiring that they would have a deserved happy ending where they would finally find some relief. As the pages turned though, I realized that the Joads represented the lives of thousands and that their fates would likely be consistent to the sore reality of what happened to the majority of the migrants on the same road as them. In order to help us to realize the bigger picture that he wanted to portray, Steinbeck used smaller chapters, that felt almost like interludes, showing us the similar situation that unidentified people were enduring.\n\nA big highlight for me was that the author succeeded in making his characters realistic, and it was plain to see that their behaviors were in line with their personalities in every one of their actions (i.e., Tom was painted since the beginning as being someone suspicious of other people\u2019s intentions and always reacting, fighting back because of that - maybe because of the time he spent in McAlester prison for committing homicide). Having known and been around tenant farmers myself, it was clear to me how Steinbeck really captured their persona, temper and features while conceiving these characters. In doing some research about him and the writing of his book, I found out that he actually bought a car, drove to Oklahoma and followed the migrants\u2019 path along Route 66 to California. Before completing The Grapes of Wrath, he wrote some reports on the subject and was working on an unfinished novel called The Oklahomans.\n\nOne of the striking traces I recognized in the Joads - and mainly everyone they met in their journey, but best represented in the book by the Wilson and the Wainwright families - was that they were truly willing to share whatever they had even under those trying times. This compassionate way of thinking and their mentality of doing good in order to receive good things ironically turned out to be working against them in more than one occasion.\n\nThroughout their ride to California, they\u2019ve encountered many individuals who had been there, looked for jobs, (some even actually worked) but instead decided to go back home because they saw that it wasn\u2019t as dreamlike as the handbills made it out to be. So the Joads were warned about it more than once but still decided to make it, convincing themselves that it\u2019d turn out different for them because they would do everything accordingly, they would work properly and be honest. Their simplistic logic blindsided them into not realizing there were bigger interests in the game. Also because of that, it was near impossible for them to understand why the big shots (through the big companies) with millions and so much land could still be so greedy, still wanting to turn a higher profit, in detriment of their (and thousands of) family\u2019s most basic needs.\n\nIn some ways - the fate of a family representing the social conditions of that time, having to bear to that situation apparently because of a few selected individuals in quest for (more) power (isn\u2019t that what it all always comes down to?) and the inevitable cause vs consequences analysis -, this novel is analogous to Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace, where we understand the effects that the French invasion had in Russia through the lives of (mainly) the Rost\u00f3vs and the Bolkonskys.\n\nFor film buffs: I\u2019ve only watched The Grapes of Wrath directed by John Ford, and I recommend it. Although there are some changes, it stays somewhat faithful to the story and the acting is on point all around, with Jane Darwell (Ma Joad) deservingly winning an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. The major difference from the novel is that the film adaptation switched some events and it ends in a high note, leaving us hopeful and optimistic, under the impression that everything will turn out well. The controversial ending of the book also isn\u2019t on the film.\n\nRating: putting aside all of the social, political and economic analysis - the book was actually banned in the USA and deemed as propaganda -, the story of the Joads is still very compelling and moving - even though Steinbeck was also accused of too much sentimentalism. It was heartbreaking to wander with them in their unfortunate journey that, sadly, left us with little hope to be expected for the family\u2019s fate: 5 stars.", "23": "NEW DELHI: There has been an upward trend in cases of farmer suicides in Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka and Punjab recently, besides reporting of instances in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, says an Intelligence Bureau note submitted to the Modi government late last week.\n\nThe December 19 report, marked to national security adviser Ajit Kumar Doval, principal secretary to the Prime Minister Nripendra Mishra, and agriculture ministry, among others, has blamed rising farmer suicides on erratic monsoon (at the onset stage) this year, outstanding loans, rising debt, low crop yield, poor procurement rate of crops and successive crop failure.

The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck is such a book.\n\nI read it during a period of recuperation after a severe bout of viral flu during my late teens. I never knew who Steinbeck was before I read this book, and I had only a sketchy idea of what the Great Depression was. After I finished it, I had become a fan of the author, and my political views had shifted permanently to the left of the spectrum.\n\n\nThe Western States nervous under the beginning change. Texas and Oklahoma, Kansas and Arkansas, New Mexico, Arizona, California. A single family moved from the land. Pa borrowed money from the bank, and now the bank wants the land. The land company--that's the bank when it has land--wants tractors, not families on the land. Is a tractor bad? Is the power that turns the long furrows wrong? If this tractor were ours it would be good--not mine, but ours. If our tractor turned the long furrows of our land, it would be good. Not my land, but ours. We could love that tractor then as we have loved this land when it was ours. But the tractor does two things--it turns the land and turns us off the land. There is little difference between this tractor and a tank. The people are driven, intimidated, hurt by both. We must think about this.\n\nOne man, one family driven from the land; this rusty car creaking along the highway to the west. I lost my land, a single tractor took my land. I am alone and bewildered. And in the night one family camps in a ditch and another family pulls in and the tents come out. The two men squat on their hams and the women and children listen. Here is the node, you who hate change and fear revolution. Keep these two squatting men apart; make them hate, fear, suspect each other. Here is the anlarge of the thing you fear. This is the zygote. For here \"I lost my land\" is changed; a cell is split and from its splitting grows the thing you hate--\"We lost our land.\" The danger is here, for two men are not as lonely and perplexed as one. And from this first \"we\" there grows a still more dangerous thing: \"I have a little food\" plus \"I have none.\" If from this problem the sum is \"We have a little food,\" the thing is on its way, the movement has direction. Only a little multiplication now, and this land, this tractor are ours. The two men squatting in a ditch, the little fire, the side-meat stewing in a single pot, the silent, stone-eyed women; behind, the children listening with their souls to words their minds do not understand. The night draws down. The baby has a cold. Here, take this blanket. It's wool. It was my mother's blanket--take it for the baby. This is the thing to bomb. This is the beginning--from \"I\" to \"we.\"\n\nIf you who own the things people must have could understand this, you might preserve yourself. If you could separate causes from results, if you could know Paine, Marx, Jefferson, Lenin, were results, not causes, you might survive. But that you cannot know. For the quality of owning freezes you forever into \"I,\" and cuts you off forever from the \"we.\"\n\nThe Western States are nervous under the beginning change. Need is the stimulus to concept, concept to action. A half-million people moving over the country; a million more restive, ready to move; ten million more feeling the first nervousness.\n\nAnd tractors turning the multiple furrows in the vacant land.\n\n\nHas there been a change? I don't think so. The news items quoted above are only a sample.\n\nThe tractors of capitalism are still mowing the vacant land.\n\n\n...and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.\n\n\nLet's hope the world sees sense before the grapes of wrath are harvested.", "24": "First, there is the feeling of failure, the guilt, the look at what we have lost, then the departure \u2014 a departure to another life, a better experience, the promise of an El Dorado. We then turn back once to the land that saw us being born: the endless journey, the first death, the hunger, the cold. But we still believe in it because we saw the leaflets that promised a job with a good salary. Even if a small voice tells us that it is not healthy, all these people who leave in the same direction. Everyone with their dreams in mind holds out. Then the arrival, the descent into hell, hunger, the cold. No house, little work and the salary that does not allow you to eat your fill. Dead, still dead. The cruel vision of the people of the new country who do not accept us but who need us for the job. The unacceptable reality and the impossible return. So our mother, who has always taken everything without flinching will become the citadel of the family motivating some, cuddling others. But nothing helps, misery is on our doorstep, disillusionment, still death. Acceptance then anger.\nA profoundly moving but realistic tale. Sublime prose on the 1929 crisis in the United States, which insidiously reminds me of the plight of our modern world. One thing has not changed; banks still have power!

But I'm so glad I kept on. Once I got going, I couldn't quit reading.\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath is a classic for a reason. The writing is careful and beautiful. The story of the Joad family, persevering in the face of unremitting hardship, is extremely moving. Tom Joad is a hero for all time. And the social critiques seems as valid today as they were in the heart of the Depression.\n\nForced off their land by the banks and drought and big farmers, the Joads head to California where they hear there's work. Thousands of others are doing the same. And when they get to California, they face hatred, prejudice, poverty and homelessness. But despite everything, and with Ma Joad as a source of strength, the Joads keep their human decency and kindness.\n\nThis book would be unbearably depressing if it weren't for the warmth of the people and the beauty of the writing. Inside all the tragedy is a seed of hope: that human beings won't take inhuman treatment forever and that many (though not all) will hold on to the spark of human warmth that help them maintain their humanity and connections with others.", "26": "WARNING: this is an extremely long and ranty review because I hate this book more than life itself.\n\nMORE WARNING: Spoilers, but I don't think you should read this book, so who cares?\n\nFURTHER WARNING: if through some strange twist of people having different opinions you loved this book and can't stand a salty, angry, comedic review of it ... well, this might not be for you.\n\nForced by her mother, a young girl listened to an audiobook version of The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck. It was something like forty hours long \u2026 and all 144,000 seconds were moments of extreme torture.\n\nLet\u2019s dig into this so-called classic and see what really ticks at the heart of high school\u2019s biggest monster.\n\nPart 1: Themes\n\nThere are some books that become \u201cclassics\u201d for no reason whatsoever. The Jungle by Upton Sinclair was one of those. However, at least every so-called \u201cclassic\u201d I\u2019ve read before has had a reason for existence or at least one or two logical points.\n\nThe Jungle showed the world the terrible conditions of meat processing factories bringing about safer conditions, cleaner food, and less disease. The Grapes of Wrath, though? As far as I can tell, it can only lead to negative consequences - blaming the government for everything that goes wrong in your life, insistence and later dependence upon Welfare, and some very incorrect very unwise views of the world.\n\nThere are many things wrong with The Grapes of Wrath. I\u2019m not the kind of person who easily understands things I can\u2019t touch and feel - like theories and symbolism - so everything I understood about the themes comes from what I\u2019ve read. I\u2019m told there\u2019s a great deal of metaphorical speaking and such - personally, I didn\u2019t pick up on the greater half of it. I think people over analyze things like paintings and books that really were pretty simple - and pretty dumb.\n\nThe first obvious belief in this novel is that everyone is part of a community of some sort - the \u201cEmersonian Oversoul\u201d is the correct term, that everyone is connected and owes everyone else their money, time, and thoughts. At the same time, Steinbeck hints that only poor people are capable of being a part of this oversoul - as Ma states, \u201cIf you\u2019re in trouble or hurt or need - go to poor people. They\u2019re the only ones that\u2019ll help - the only ones.\u201d (Stupid rich people who are all evil. Every single one of them.)\n\nThrough this connection, there\u2019s supposedly a kind of continuity to life. The turtle in chapter three symbolizes the perpetuation of the life circle, as does that whole creepy thing at the end with Rose of Sharon and the old guy. (I\u2019ll talk more about that in the \u201cStupid Dumb Okies\u201d section.)\n\nAs a commentary I read explains, \u201cJim Casy\u2019s reference to sin and virtue being part of one thing prefigures his concept of the oversoul, the belief that all souls are just small parts of one large soul.\u201d First of all, what a load of garbage. (My apologies to anyone who believes this, I respect you, but \u2026 nope. Sorry. Individualism in Jesus Christ for me!).\n\nSecond, let\u2019s talk a little bit about Jim Casy. Casy is an immoral, stinking old man who seduces young women while masquerading as a preacher. Sounds like a special guy, right? Honestly, I can\u2019t understand why this would be acceptable, even in the 1930s. Maybe even more so in the \u201830s as far as the sleeping around side of it; less so as far as the age discrepancy probably present, etc.\n\nNow, back to the government. In this book, \u201cgovernment camps\u201d are treated like a kind of Heaven. Who is paying for the government camps? The government. Why? Because the government\u2019s sole responsibility is to provide every need and comfort to the sojourners from Oklahoma and other parts of the Midwest. Who \u2026 the government wronged?\n\nLet\u2019s do a quick breakdown of what actually happened to the Midwesterners beneath all the subterfuge of Steinbeck\u2019s prose (more on that later).\n\n1: Stock market crashed in 1929.\n-Let\u2019s stop for a moment to note that it crashed because of the greedy American people who invested in it.\n-But that\u2019s not the government\u2019s fault, really.\n-The government shouldn\u2019t be involved in trade and business. It\u2019s not the government\u2019s job.\n2: The banks all failed and there was no money to loan to folks.\n-Again, not the government, but whatevs.\n3: In the Midwest, over-worked lands and dry weather created the Dust Bowl.\n-OH NO DID THE GOVERNMENT RUIN THE WEATHER???\n-Stupid government.\n-#GlobalWarming\n4: New equipment got invented that could make farming easier.\n-Stupid government. Inventing new farming equipment.\n5: Land-owners actually wanted to efficiently harvest crops rather than give charity to a whole ton of farmers.\n-I HATE THE GOVERNMENT.\n-THE GOVERNMENT SUCKS.\n-DOWN WITH THE GOVERNMENT.\n-(or rather gimme some more government, because only government can make this right, let\u2019s all be Communists together.)\n6: Farmers got kicked off the land that they didn\u2019t own and had no right to stay on.\n-(It\u2019s kinda weird that they have such loyalty to land they don\u2019t even own, but whatever.)\n7: Farmers moved West to California because they were uneducated and could not do anything but farm.\n-Dang, government. You\u2019re so mean.\n\nLook \u2026 I hate the government myself. But for the exact opposite reason of this book. I hate the government because it seeks more power than it should have \u2026 and people rely on it more than they ever should.\n\nThe government is there to govern. Not to provide us good lives. The American dream is not \u201cand then the United States gave us a good life free of charge.\u201d No, it\u2019s \u201cThe United States gave us the opportunity to work hard and, from the sweat of our brows, to build a good life.\u201d\n\nSometimes that has been harder than others \u2026 but for this particular event/issue you can\u2019t blame the government!\n\nAlso, I want to take a moment to say that though Connie is a terrible wishy-washy idiot, he kind of had the right idea with what the novel treats like \u2018crazy dreams.\u2019 If he got an education and went into some sort of technical line of work, he would have done well.\n\nPart 2: Writing Style\n\nI read that Steinbeck\u2019s style was influenced by the King James Version of the Bible. Uh \u2026 no. The KJV isn\u2019t quite so dead and hopeless. The Grapes of Wrath\u2019s style is dry, rambling, and boring. There\u2019s nothing happy, uplifting, poetic, or good about it. It\u2019s a lifeless droning. There\u2019s no real feeling in it - no real grasp of humanity.\n\nMost of the book consists of the meaningless conversations of one character with another character. They talk about everything under the sun - but it never gets anywhere. The rest of the book is extremely long descriptions which was sure to make you fall asleep. Only the fact that I was driving while listening to this story kept me awake - that\u2019s for sure!\n\nAnother literary technique Steinbeck uses often is repetition. It\u2019s particularly evident in chapter seven. As my commentary says, the chapter \u201c\u2026 is a staccato monologue delivered by a used car salesman pitching jalopies to dispossessed croppers.\u201d\n\nWell, it does show well how the salesman is manipulating the farmers, but it\u2019s still boring and could be cut down to maybe a few paragraphs. In fact, I\u2019d say most of the book could be cut down to just a few paragraphs - the repetition isn\u2019t used just as a literary device, but rather the whole book is repetition.\n\nIt\u2019s true that repetition ingrains things into peoples\u2019 heads. I think The Grapes of Wrath is trying to ingrain the Joad\u2019s whiny story into our heads.\n\nThere is no main character in this book. At first you say, \u201cWell, Tom, of course!\u201d But really, every minor character is the main character. It\u2019s confusing and makes it impossible to truly sympathize with everyone. You\u2019re left in apathy, not caring what happens to the characters.\n\nWhich brings us to \u2026\n\nPart 3: Stupid Dumb Okies\n\nIn California, they hate people from Oklahoma and call them \u201cOkies,\u201d usually with five or six cuss words/profanities attached. However, Steinbeck does nothing whatsoever to counteract this. In fact, the \u201cOkies\u201d are incredibly dumb! Uh \u2026 good job grinding the reputation of Oklahoma into the ground \u2026?\n\nAll of the Joad family and most of the characters we meet are incredibly dumb. They do dumb things; they say dumb things; they personify dumbness! Honestly, is anyone in this book likable at all? Let\u2019s see \u2026\n\nThere\u2019s Tom. He\u2019s a many-time murderer who hates everyone and everything and isn\u2019t afraid to show it. He has a terrible temper and is known for lashing out at everyone in sight. He also sleeps around. A lot.\n\nThen there\u2019s Ma. On the surface, she seems pretty cool, the calm and controlled one of the family. However, she is also pretty dumb, seeming to think that Tom is actually a good guy. Sorry, weak-willed mother. Your children mostly suck? She was probably the best character of the story. Also, you let your mentally disabled son wander off and didn\u2019t even go looking for him. Good job.\n\nJim Casy is the former preacher who makes fun of the Bible, of God, and basically everything related to Christianity. He sleeps around even more than Tom, seducing young women who he was supposed to be a spiritual guide to. So likable. He also doesn\u2019t believe that morals are a thing. Though neither does anyone else in this book, to be fair.\n\nRose of Sharon Joad (or Rosasharn, haha). She\u2019s a great character. Whines about anything, thinks about nothing but herself, is generally weak-willed and annoying. At the end, she decides to nurse an old man who\u2019s dying of hunger. And I don\u2019t mean \u201cnurse back to health.\u201d I mean, nurse, like one would nurse a baby. That\u2019s not creepy and disgusting at all \u2026 (Another point against Ma: she let that happen and in fact encouraged it. Ma is actually a pretty bad Ma, to be honest?)\n\nPa Joad is weak-willed and annoying and has no idea how to lead his family, leaving them hanging and letting Ma take over.\n\nAl, the Joad\u2019s teenage boy, could be summed up in two words: Wants Girls. He loves having sex, and he has sex all the times with multiple girls and brags on it. I just love this guy \u2026 one of my favorites!\n\nGranpa Joad. He cusses, walks around with his clothes unbuttoned \u2026 and I mean even his underwear \u2026 and is basically dirty filthy, inside and out. No grief when he dies. I didn\u2019t even care.\n\nGranma Joad. She prays, but since Christianity is a ridiculous stupid silly thing this is just ridiculous and leaves her open to ridicule. Though to be fair she is 100% senile. But they treated this as comical and make fun of her, kinda? But when she dies, again, I wasn\u2019t that sad. Like, okay, now we don\u2019t have to deal with her extremely annoying voice.\n\nUncle John. Can\u2019t get over himself. *eye roll* He needs Jesus\u2019 grace to move past his life, but of course no one in this novel will offer that to him. Even when he almost asks for it. People in this book suck.\n\nRuthie. Bossy and domineering little girl. Winfield. Spoiled brat.\n\nNoah. Actually, he\u2019s kinda sweet \u2026 I like him. But then in the end he wanders off. Because the Joad family are jerks and won\u2019t take care of their son who has a mental disability.\n\nYay for Noah? Even though Noah is only a good guy because his father bashed his brains out when he was a newborn?\n\nPart 4: Plot (Is there one?)\n\nThe basic \u201cplot\u201d of the book goes like this. ( Spoilers included, of course.)\n\n1: Tom gets out of jail (for murder). Comes home, picks up Filthy Casy on the way. Finds his family home abandoned. Eventually makes his way to his Uncle\u2019s farm more or less where his family is preparing to leave for California.\n2: After chapters and chapters of absolute boring dry sentimental nonsense that is no help to anyone, let alone the plot, they head out to California. They slowly get there in another boring, long section. Granma and Granpa both die, by the way. No one really cares, though, let alone me.\n3: They get to California. The work they thought they were going to get - even after they were warned several times by multiple people that there would be no work - isn\u2019t there.\n4: They live at a bad camp, then they move to a government camp which is nice except there\u2019s still no work, so they don\u2019t have food. Eventually they leave the government camp and go to another place where they pick peaches. Connie abandons \u201cRosasharn,\u201d his wife and Tom\u2019s sister, at this point, and she whines a lot. Even though she\u2019s the one who married the shiftless idiot. Whatever.\n5: Anyway, at some point in here, Tom\u2019s temper flares up once again. And now he\u2019s SERIOUSLY in trouble and runs away from the family. Good riddance to bad rubbish.\n6: Then they end up living in these abandoned boxcars as they pick cotton. And the river floods. And Rosasharn\u2019s baby is stillborn, but at this point I couldn\u2019t care less. And after a couple days of living on a platform they built above the water in the boxcar, they decide to leave. Although Al stays behind. And at this point Casy isn\u2019t around anymore, by the way. #dead\n6: So they (everyone but Al and the dead people and the people who have run off) walk down the road and it starts to rain. They go into this barn, there\u2019s a starving guy, and Rosasharn offers him her breast milk, it is disgusting.\n7: The End?\n\nOkay, isn\u2019t that the most exciting, interesting, intriguing plot, EVER?!\n\nI know, it\u2019s dry as a bone. I frankly don\u2019t know why or how anyone would enjoy it!\n\nPart 5: Negative Content\n\nThis is the most disgusting part about the book. The content. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous! How could one book be so packed full of cussing, profanity, sexual innuendoes and references and acts, filthy people, cruel and immoral men and women, and all manners of sin and evilness and darkness? It\u2019s like a hell hole in there.\n\nThe whole moods of this book is made doubly dark by the content. I would say 18+, but it\u2019s more like 92+. Even then I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. 92-year-olds don\u2019t need their minds pervaded by this filth, either.\n\nJust to give you a small selection of what is contained between the pages of this book - as it would take me almost a full book to list every little thing - here\u2019s a few things I remember off the top of my head.\n\nProfanity/Taking the Lord\u2019s Name in Vain: G*ddamn in all its forms, G*d in all its forms, Chr*st, J*sus Chr*st, and several other forms of those words taken in a vary light way. Tom\u2019s favorite expression, in fact, was \u201cChr*st.\u201d Thanks a lot for using my Lord and Savior\u2019s name like that, Tom. I appreciate it. So much that I wanted to vomit about a hundred times every page due to it.\n\nCussing: d*mn in all its forms, sh*t in all its forms, h*ll in all its forms, various other words. B*tch (and related words) in all its forms. No f-bombs that I remember (and I probably would have remembered), but the frequency of the other words was SUPER high. As in, high enough to more than make up for it.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a single character who didn\u2019t spew profanity every time they spoke. Sometimes they were cussing more than they were using actual words! It was ridiculous and unnecessary and gross.\n\nSexual: Lots of kissing/necking/petting, etc. Never described in great detail, but it\u2019s there. There\u2019s one scene where I believe Rosasharn (can\u2019t be bothered with typing out her whole name) and Connie have sex or at least it\u2019s alluded to very heavily, and basically talk about afterwards and beforewards and wanting each other and what not.\n\nTom, Casy, and Al all talk about sleeping with women, how much they want to sleep with women, etc. for hours on end. Many, many sexual jokes and innuendos and references. Lots of similar filthy talk. It was pretty constant.\n\nOther: Death, destruction, murder, violence, scary scenes, police violence, mobs, scummy living conditions. Take your pick, I\u2019ve got more! (Not that all of that is necessarily something that shouldn\u2019t have been included, but it added to the dark and dim and hopeless feeling of the book.)\n\nWould you believe that\u2019s only a small selection? It is indeed a super filthy book. Not one anyone under eighteen should ever pick up - poor high school students, how can you be expected to thrive when you must read this trash? - and even after that why would an adult want to read this? Ever? Too filthy for words, and all for no reason whatsoever.\n\nPart End: Conclusion\n\nNow, you can say whatever you want to me. You can say I didn\u2019t understand it. You can\n\nsay I\u2019m just a silly highschooler who doesn\u2019t know a thing about fine literature. But this is a 1-star book! It\u2019s six hundred pages of absolute nonsense delivered in a boring, dry way.\n\nWho would I recommend this book to? Absolutely no one. Don\u2019t waste your time. If you can get out of it, get out of it! Your life is too precious to waste on The Grapes of Wrath.\n\nWhy are so many high school students forced to read this? For no reason whatsoever that I can see? Because people nowadays think the government needs to take care of them? Because Satan wants to make young folks hate all classics, not read them, and therefore not be inspired to be good people? That\u2019s taking it a tad too far, but it feels almost true!\n\nThanks for reading,\n\n~Kellyn Roth, Reveries Reviews", "27": "Book Review\n3 out of 5 stars to The Grapes of Wrath, written in 1939 by John Steinbeck. I might have an unpopular opinion when it comes to this book, as it was fine but nothing fantastic for me. I admit, I read this in middle school, nearly 25 years ago, and never went back to read it again. I tend not to like books about awful things as the main plot. I don't mind when bad things happen, or circumstances change, but when the entire book is about the pain and suffering of a family, it doesn't usually rise to the top of my TBR. I might consider giving this one another chance, but you have some major convincing to do. I like Steinbeck, too, so it's not so much an issue with the author as it is with the topic. The writing is strong. The imagery is good. The characters are well drawn. The setting is very detailed. But when it comes to the plight of a family against the hardships all around them, it's a difficult read. Part of my issue may have been a connection with the story. While I certainly don't have a real-life connection with my favorite books (mysteries, thrillers...), you need to have an understanding and recognition between what's happening and how you live. Coming from the northeast, in a major metropolitan city, 50+ years after these times, it doesn't start off as something I'm familiar with. I usually don't read things about this time period or space for those reasons. If the characters called to me, I might have liked it more. Don't get me wrong... it's a good book. And it's got a place in the world of classics. And it helped highlight a lot of wrongs that people weren't aware of. And maybe because I learned those lessons from other books and other places, this one just didn't seem all that top notch to me. That said, it's Steinbeck, so there is something of value here. No one can tell reality like he can.\n\nAbout Me\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

They headed to California in hope of a new life, instead their hardships multiplied.\n\nTom Joad, as played by Henry Fonda, is the face of John Ford\u2019s excellent film version from 1940; however, Ma Joad is the heart and soul of the book. As the male characters give in to fear, rage and depression, Ma Joad tries desperately to hold her family together.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why this is a revered classic. Steinbeck\u2019s writing is brimming with tension, poignancy and some of the greatest characters in American literature. When I home schooled my son, this was one of his favorites and as a measure to its greatness, we still talk about it today, especially the quasi-mystical symbol-laden ending.\n\nThat\u2019s the power of books and reading.", "29": "If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.\n\n\n\nInfection in Literature: \"The Grapes of Wrath\" by John Steinbeck\n\n\n\n(Original Review, 2002)\n\n\nThere's no reason why we should judge a film on the basis of how faithful or otherwise it is to the book: it should be judged by how good it is as a film. The ending of the book could not be depicted on film in those days because censorship would not have allowed it, but there's no reason to assume that Ford would have filmed Steinbeck's ending had he been able to. The artistic vision Ford was expressing was not Steinbeck's, but his own. My own view is that Steinbeck was a fine novelist, but that Ford was a great film-maker. Steinbeck's \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is a fine novel, but Ford's \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is a great film.", "30": "I first read Grapes of Wrath in high school, then again taught it in a rural parochial (Christian) high school) in western Michigan in the late seventies. I loved teaching that book, that had been a staple of the Modern Novels elective class there for many years, but that year one of the more conservative parents complained to the school board that the book was immoral, not consistent with the values of the community. He saw that his son was being required to read it, recalled reading the book and found it personally offensive. He thought the swearing was excessive (made a list of the swear words used), there was an ex-preacher in the book that had slept with some of his female parishioners he took objection to, and the final scene in the book, where a young nursing mother who has lost her child feeds a starving man, he found disgusting. If he had dug a little deeper he might have discovered that the author of the book, John Steinbeck, was also once a member of the Communist Party. We might have then had just enough evidence to burn it.\n\nThe only member of the school board that had read the book was the Chairman of the Board, who thought it was a very good book, but none of the other members had read it, nor would they, and they voted to remove it from our English curriculum, though they--sensing a possible insurrection from students and teachers---allowed us to finish teaching the book. Why fear an uprising? As I knew the board was meeting to vote on the book, I invited my students to write essays for them on the question of the book\u2019s morality, and several of them wrote stirring defenses of the book, to no avail. I am sure our reading of the remainder of that book was some of the most passionate learning I have ever been part of, and I will never forget my engaged, thoroughly committed students; I loved them (some [minor] students bought me bottles of wine when we were done reading it) and the book; what a great and anguished experience for us all.\n\nWhen John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath he had spent time in the camps in California. He had helped organize farm workers for a living wage. He had seen first hand the lowering of wages for hundreds of thousands of Americans in his state to the point of starvation and disease. When he wrote the book he had the King James version of the Holy Bible with him at all times, I had read, hoping to have his passionate prose echo its lyrical moral tone.\n\nThe story, which is at its base a critique of the inhumanity of unbridled capitalism, a story of man-made environmental disaster and the strength of the human spirit in the face of unspeakable challenges and tragedy, focuses primarily on one family, the Joads, one of thousands who lost their farms in the \u201cDust Bowl\u201d era in the thirties when adequate safety nets were not available, when there was no unemployment relief, when adequate union action was still a dream, when American citizens were actually refugees in their own country, when people starved in the streets for lack of a crust of bread. In other words, it is both historical fiction and a cautionary tale, a time of Economic Depression and people (often, and largely) hating each other in their struggles rather than supporting each other in crisis.\n\nThe Joads--Ma, Pa, Uncle John, Tom, Noah, Rose of Sharon, Grandpa, and Grandma, Ruthie and Winfield, their dogs, accompanied for a time by ex-preacher Jim Casey--were living through a drought, their farms had become clouds of dust, they couldn't raise crops, so they couldn\u2019t make mortgage payments to the bank as hundreds of thousands could not, they were pushed off their land, their house and barn razed,\n\n\u201cSure, cried the tenant men, but it\u2019s our land. . . We were born on it, and we got killed on it, died on it. Even if it\u2019s no good, it\u2019s still ours. . . That\u2019s what makes ownership, not a paper with numbers on it.\"\n\nAnd they, from Oklahoma, called \u201cOkies\u201d and worse, saw flyers for jobs in California and suddenly they and a whole area country headed west for twenty times fewer jobs than there were people. And what happens in a capitalist system when that happens? Wages go down to criminal levels, prices stay up, and food is literally kerosened or dumped into ditches in front of starving people (as is now being done!!).\n\n\u201cDump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out. Slaughter the pigs and bury them, and let the putrescence drip down into the earth.\n\nThere is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificate- died of malnutrition- because the food must rot, must be forced to rot.\u201d\n\nHatred is showered on poor people for their poverty, for their willingness to attempt to feed their families for less money, for impossibly low wages, police forces are doubled to move people along, doctors won\u2019t see these refugees, these migrants, these \u201cshitheels,\u201d and prices are gouged by their fellow Americans for almost every essential item.\n\nLet\u2019s just pause a second and think of the environmental disaster in Syria that created waves of migrants/refugees all over Europe, and that wall at the US-Mexican border, and the ongoing refugee crises all over the world and see if you think this might be a useful book for us to again read.\n\nThe structure of the book includes a close reading of one family\u2019s tale alternating with the story of the situation writ a little larger, with unnamed folks appearing, inter-callary chapters that allow the author to help us understand the economic crisis and its human/moral costs on a broader, systemic level, and lyrical/metaphorical interludes such as one featuring a turtle persistently trying to cross a highway.\n\nThe key theme is that The People can stand against the rich and powerful if they are unified, if they are One, if they see themselves as Ma tells them they must be, a Family, supporting each other with love and decency. That final scene in the rain reminds me of the father and son at the end of Cormac McCarthy\u2019s The Road: You do the right thing and live the right way until you die. But while tender acts of charity are present, there are also also warnings in the book: If you keep a family from feeding its children that rage--the grapes of wrath--will come to pass. The people will come together to save themselves.\n\n\u201c. . . and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.\u201d\n\nMa emerges as the matriarchal moral center of the book, and women are seen as the central foundation of human survival. Which makes sense more now than ever.\n\n\u201cShe seemed to know, to accept, to welcome her position, the citadel of the family, the strong place that could not be taken.\u201d\n\nAnd along the way they learn moral/political lessons in the face of police crackdowns on the hungry:\n\n\u201cAnd the little screaming fact that sounds through all history: Repression works only to strengthen and knit the repressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he needs a million acres to make him feel rich, seems to me he needs it 'cause he feels awful poor inside hisself, and if he's poor in hisself, there ain't no million acres gonna make him feel rich, an' maybe he's disappointed that nothin' he can do 'll make him feel rich.\u201d\n\n\"We\u2019re sorry.

There are hundreds of editions worldwide and swarms of five star reviews.\n\n\u201cThe Grapes of Wrath\u201d is a book of great weight (literally and metaphorically). It\u2019s epic and as timeless as the history which repeats itself with a stubborn regularity. There have always been changes and there have always been people left behind, people who found themselves outside the whatever brave new world which had no place for them. And there have always been people who didn\u2019t want to know about them, who didn\u2019t want to hear about them. John, I know you wrote this book for them, so that no one could feign ignorance. And I get it, John, your heart is in the right place.\n\nYou did all the right things. Those ever so gentle shifts in the patriarchal society? Brilliant. You know how to warm my feminist heart with the portrayal of Ma who takes the reins over from Pa. Although, are you trying to say it\u2019s a good thing that women take over when the world has gone to dogs or that it is another symptom of the world going to dogs? I don\u2019t know. Never mind. According to new goodreads review guidelines I can\u2019t judge you as a person, so let\u2019s leave it. Let\u2019s talk about your writing. A chapter about a turtle crossing a road? How did you pull that off? It should be proverbially boring and yet, I read it with a bated breath. Will the turtle make it to the other side of the road? Or that last final scene? Worth the seven hundred pages it takes to get to it.\nI grew to love the Joads, John, even though I know they\u2019re just pawns in your game.

You want us all to spare a thought for all the dispossessed of the world, those who loved earth and were one with it but they were forced to quit and abandon their land, to break that sacred bond and were replaced by soulless tractors and faceless banks and corporations.\n\nYou\u2019re preaching to the choir, John. My heart is in the right place, too.\n\nBut you know what, John? And please, don\u2019t take it the wrong way, I did love your book, but you weren\u2019t subtle. I like my men subtle."}
